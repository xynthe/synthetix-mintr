# Mintr v2

This is the code for the new Synthetix Mintr dApp: https://mintr.synthetix.io.

For translator instructions, [go here](#translator-instructions).

The dApp communicates with the [Synthetix contracts](https://developer.synthetix.io/api/docs/deployed-contracts.html), allowing users to perform the following actions:

- Mint (aka Issue) `sUSD` by locking `SNX`
- Claim rewards of both `SNX` (inflation) and `sUSD` (exchange fees) every week
- Burn `sUSD` to unlock `SNX`
- Transfer `SNX` to other accounts
- Deposit (or withdrawl) `sUSD` into the `Depot` contract, to go in the queue for exchanging with `ETH` at current market price

Mintr v2 supports the following wallet providers:

- Metamask
- Trezor
- Ledger
- Coinbase Wallet

## Translator instructions

1. Fork this repo using the fork button on the top right ^^^.
2. Create language folder using your language code https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes in the `public/locales` folder e.g public/locales/es/.
3. Copy the `public/locales/en/translation.json` file.
4. Paste it into your langage folder e.g. public/locales/es/translation.json
5. Translate English to your language
6. Submit PR back to this repo

Before submitting a translation, please make sure to respect the following repository architecture:
`public/locales/{LANG-CODE}/translation.json`
with {LANG-CODE} the language code for your language to translate.

Examples:

```
public/locales/fr/translation.json
public/locales/es/translation.json
```

Please make sure to use the latest version of the english (en) file as a reference before starting the translation.

`translation.json` follows a simple key:value format which has to be respected in order to be published.

```
	"home": {
		"intro": {
			"title": "What would you like to do?",
			"subtitle": "Click any button below to view more info, confirm or change the amount before submitting."
		},
	},
```

With the example above, a new translation should look like:

```
	"home": {
		"intro": {
			"title": "YOUR_TRANSLATION",
			"subtitle": "YOUR_TRANSLATION"
		},
	},
```

To be merged and published a translation will have to cover every key:value.
